# Bellabeat Case Study: Smart Device Data Analysis

## Project Overview
[cite_start]This project analyzes physical activity data from smart device users to help Bellabeat, a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women, optimize its marketing strategy. [cite: 1, 2]

## Key Goals
* [cite_start]Analyze consumer behavior using open-source Fitbit data. [cite: 3, 5]
* [cite_start]Identify trends and growth opportunities for Bellabeat products. [cite: 3]
* [cite_start]Provide data-driven strategic recommendations. [cite: 315]

## Tools Used
* [cite_start]**SQL (BigQuery)**: For data cleaning, joining tables, and user categorization. [cite: 33, 58, 88]
* [cite_start]**Google Sheets**: For initial data cleaning and formatting. [cite: 24]
* [cite_start]**R (ggplot2)**: For data visualization and identifying patterns. [cite: 108, 148, 179]

## Data Audit & Integrity
During the analysis, I identified several critical data limitations:
* [cite_start]**Time Period**: The data actually covers only 2 days instead of the stated period. [cite: 9, 301]
* [cite_start]**Sample Size**: 33 users were analyzed instead of the 30 originally mentioned. [cite: 9, 303]
* [cite_start]**Reliability**: Due to the short 48-hour observation period, the data is used to identify general trends rather than long-term habits. [cite: 304, 306]

## Key Insights
* [cite_start]**User Engagement**: 88% of analyzed users are "Power Users" who track their data daily. [cite: 92, 94]
* [cite_start]**Activity vs Calories**: Confirmed a strong positive correlation between high-intensity activity and calorie burn. [cite: 295, 309]
* [cite_start]**Sedentary Behavior**: Even active users spend an average of 990 minutes per day being sedentary. [cite: 170]
* [cite_start]**Step Goals**: Most users consistently stay below the recommended 7,500-step health threshold. [cite: 269, 313]

## Recommendations
* [cite_start]Implement notifications to encourage high-intensity "short bursts" of activity. [cite: 318]
* [cite_start]Use educational alerts regarding WHO and health standards (30 mins activity/7,500 steps). [cite: 311, 319]
* [cite_start]Improve long-term data collection (30+ days) for more personalized reporting. [cite: 321]
